Create your first class!

Let's say you're creating a class (a template) to easily manage storing your barbie movies info

```
class Barbie{
  public:
    string name;
    string movie;
    int year;
};
```

Understand the elements:
1. ```class Barbie``` is the basic boilerplate for your class, get creative with the class name! you can use MyClass, Barbie (like I did), MyBarbie, MyFirstClass
2. ```public``` (explained in detail here) is a setting for your "attributes"
